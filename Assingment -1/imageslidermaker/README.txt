To get your slider working in your web page, you must add
my-slider.css, ism-2.2.min.js and the slide images to your project
directory and paste the markup (included below) into your HTML.

For a working example, open example.html in your web browser or
follow the instructions below to integrate the slider into your
project.


Step by step instructions
-------------------------

1. Paste the following into the head of your HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="ism/css/my-slider.css"/>
<script src="ism/js/ism-2.2.min.js"></script>


2. Paste this into the body of your HTML file (at the location where:
   you would like your slider to appear in the page):

<div class="ism-slider" data-transition_type="fade" data-play_type="once" data-radios="false" id="my-slider">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <img src="ism/image/slides/_u/1692864490945_611734.webp">
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="ism/image/slides/_u/1692864476422_569699.webp">
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>



3. Copy the ism/ directory into the root directory of your project.

   The css, js and image paths are relative, meaning the ism/
   directory should be in the same directory (path) as your HTML
   file containing the slider.
